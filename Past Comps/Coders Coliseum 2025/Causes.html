    <h1>Where Does Marine Debris Come From?</h1>
    <p>
        Marine debris has many different sources, but most of it originates from human activity.
        Improperly managed waste, careless habits, and unsustainable production all contribute to the growing problem of
        trash in the ocean.
    </p>

    <h2>Main Causes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improper Waste Disposal:</strong> Trash thrown on the ground, streets, or beaches can easily be
            carried by wind or rain into waterways that flow into the sea.</li>
        <li><strong>Single-Use Plastics:</strong> Everyday items like bags, bottles, straws, and food wrappers are used
            once and often discarded without recycling.</li>
        <li><strong>Fishing Industry:</strong> Lost or abandoned nets, lines, and traps (known as "ghost gear") account
            for a large share of ocean debris.</li>
        <li><strong>Shipping and Boating:</strong> Waste and cargo accidentally or illegally dumped into the sea from
            vessels.</li>
        <li><strong>Natural Disasters:</strong> Floods, storms, and hurricanes can wash huge amounts of litter and
            debris from land into the ocean.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Human-Made Problem</h2>
    <p>
        Marine debris is ultimately caused by human choices. The convenience of plastics, poor waste management systems,
        and lack of awareness
        all combine to push more and more trash into the ocean. Because of this, it is a problem that people also have
        the power to solve.
