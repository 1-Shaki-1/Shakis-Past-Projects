    <h1>How Does Marine Debris Affect Us?</h1>
    <p>
      Marine debris has harmful effects on marine life, ecosystems, economies, and even human health. 
      Because so much of it is plastic, it lasts for decades and continues to cause damage long after it enters the ocean.
    </p>

    <h2>Impacts on Marine Life</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entanglement:</strong> Animals such as turtles, seals, and birds can get caught in discarded nets, ropes, or plastic rings, which can injure or kill them.</li>
      <li><strong>Ingestion:</strong> Marine animals often mistake small pieces of plastic for food. This can block their digestive systems and cause starvation.</li>
      <li><strong>Ghost Fishing:</strong> Lost fishing gear continues to trap and kill fish and other creatures for years.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impacts on Ecosystems</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Coral Reefs:</strong> Debris can break corals and block sunlight, reducing reef health.</li>
      <li><strong>Beaches:</strong> Litter damages natural beauty, reduces tourism, and can harm coastal wildlife.</li>
      <li><strong>Water Quality:</strong> Microplastics spread through the water and enter the food chain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impacts on People</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Economic Loss:</strong> Tourism suffers when beaches are dirty, and fishing industries lose income due to damaged ecosystems.</li>
      <li><strong>Human Health:</strong> Microplastics consumed by fish and seafood eventually end up on our plates, posing potential health risks.</li>
      <li><strong>Navigation Hazards:</strong> Large debris like abandoned fishing nets can damage ships or endanger sailors.</li>
    </ul>
