    <h1>What is Marine Debris?</h1>
    <p>
      Marine debris is <strong>any persistent, human-made solid material that is discarded, disposed of, or abandoned in the marine and coastal environment</strong>. 
      It is one of the most widespread pollution problems facing the world's oceans and waterways today.
    </p>

    <h2>Examples of Marine Debris</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Plastics</strong>: bags, bottles, straws, packaging, and microplastics.</li>
      <li><strong>Fishing gear</strong>: nets, lines, traps, also called “ghost gear.”</li>
      <li><strong>Metal</strong>: cans, fishing hooks, and ship scraps.</li>
      <li><strong>Glass</strong>: bottles and broken fragments.</li>
      <li><strong>Rubber</strong>: tires, balloons, and gloves.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Does it Get into the Ocean?</h2>
    <p>
      Most marine debris comes from land-based activities. Trash that is improperly managed 
      can be blown by wind, washed by rain, or carried by rivers into the sea. 
      Other sources include ships, boats, and offshore platforms that directly or indirectly release waste.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is Marine Debris a Problem?</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike natural materials, much of marine debris—especially plastics—does not break down easily. 
      Instead, it remains in the ocean for years, breaking into smaller pieces called microplastics. 
      This debris threatens marine life, damages ecosystems, and can even end up in the human food chain.

      <em>“Marine debris is not just an ocean problem — it’s a people problem. 
      Every piece of trash in the ocean came from us, and that means we can solve it.”</em>
