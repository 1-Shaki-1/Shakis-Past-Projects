    <h1>How Can We Solve the Problem?</h1>
        <p>
            The problem of marine debris may be global, but it can be tackled with local, national, and international
            action.
            By changing human habits, improving waste management, and raising awareness, we can protect our oceans for
            the future.
        </p>

        <h2>Individual Actions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle:</strong> Use fewer single-use plastics and recycle whenever possible.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Choose Alternatives:</strong> Replace plastic bags, straws, and bottles with reusable items.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Join Cleanups:</strong> Participate in local beach or river cleanups to remove trash before it
                enters the ocean.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Community and Government Efforts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> Invest in better collection, recycling, and disposal systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Legislation:</strong> Support bans or taxes on harmful single-use plastics like bags and
                microbeads.</li>
            <li><strong>Awareness Campaigns:</strong> Educate the public, especially young people, about the impacts of
                marine debris.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Global Solutions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>International Cooperation:</strong> Countries working together to manage plastic waste and
                protect oceans.</li>
            <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Development of biodegradable materials and better fishing gear to reduce
                pollution.</li>
            <li><strong>Research:</strong> Scientists studying marine debris to understand its impacts and find new
                solutions.</li>
        </ul>
